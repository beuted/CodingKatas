# Coding Katas

This repo is regrouping some simple exercices I did in order to practice TDD. These are in C# and require the nuget packages `NUnit` & `Nfluent`. Ideally you also want to install and run `NCrunch` when working on them. (Obviously `Resharper` is a must have)

The exercice's statments are in the folder `Exercices/`, Some support is available in the `TDD Support/` folder and my solutions are on the `CodingKatas.sln` solution.
